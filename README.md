# Usage

The easiest way is using conda

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate retro
```

you will then need to add gym-snes to retro.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:esteveste/gym-SuperMarioKart-Snes.git
```

You then need to copy the folder SuperMarioKart-Snes into site-packages/retro/data/stable/SuperMarioKart-Snes as explained in the repo above. Something like this :

```bash
cp -r gym-SuperMarioKart-Snes/SuperMarioKart-Snes /home/user/miniconda3/envs/env_name/lib/python3.7/site-packages/retro/data/stable/.
```

### Checkpoints and datasets

python train.py
```

To train ppo :

```bash
python train_ppo.py
```

### Running


To play a game with ppo :
